					<div class="label chicken">Chicken</div>
					<p>My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to do it this way all the time. I never have had a chicken this juicy before; this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. It's funny. We nibble on the celery after.</p>

					<div class="label beef">Beef</div>
					<p>This is an authentic Korean beef rib recipe, not the Americanized version. This is super easy and a crowd pleaser. This is for 4 pounds of ribs. I find 2 tablespoons of honey is perfect for a not-so-sweet rib. This gives you the perfect amount of tanginess. However, if you like it sweeter you can add up to 3 tablespoons.</p>

					<div class="label sushi">Sushi</div>
					<p>Delicious and festive uramaki sushi roll featuring unagi, avocado, and shrimp tempura. It's fun to decorate the roll to look like a dragon! Serve with unagi sauce, soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.</p>
